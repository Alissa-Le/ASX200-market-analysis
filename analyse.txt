# correlation: asx vs other market indices
All the correlations are strongly positive (0.8-0.96).
This tells us that ASX200 tends to move in the same direction
with the major global indices. This make sense as the ASX200
reflects international investor sentiment and global economic
trends. However, the one lower correlation (Shanghai = 0.44)
might suggest that China's market behaves more independently
from the Western markets.

# correlation: asx vs currency
Most correlations are negative, meaning when the ASX200 rises,
those foreign currencies such as USA, EUR and CNY tend to
weaken against the AUD, or vice versa. That makes sense as
a stronger Australian stock market often coincides with a
stronger AUD, leading to inverse relationships with foreign
currencies. However, 10,000 IDR (Indonesian Rupiah) shows a
small positive correlation (0.45), that could be noise or a
regional trade effect.

# correlation: asx vs bond
Most yields are negatively correlated with ASX200 (-0.6 to
-0.77). This fits real-world behaviour as when bond yields rise
(interest rates increase), stock markets often decline due to
higher borrowing costs and reduced investment motivation. The
few positive correlations such as Singapore 1yr (0.79) and US 1yr
(0.71) may reflect localised market factors or data variations.

# correlation: asx vs RBA-rate
The RBA-rate shows a strong inverse relationship with the ASX200, with
a correlation of -0.8. This aligns with the real-world economy, where
rising interest rates increase borrowing costs and can dampen
economic activity and corporate profitability, leading to declines
in stock market performance. Coversely, lower interest rates reduce
financing costs, stimulate spending and investment, and often
contribute to upward movements in the ASX200.

==> Overall: From the correlation analysis, ASX200 demonstrates
strong dependency on global stock indices, moderate to strong
inverse relationships with foreign currency exchange rates, and
negative correlation with global bond yields and RBA-rate. These patterns
align with established macro-financial theory where global
equity movements, exchange rate dynamics, and interest rate
changes jointly influence Australian market performance

#trend visualisation
The ASX200 index started at a relatively low level of around 4,300 in mid-2010,
showing mild fluctuations until 2012, when it experienced a notable
downturn below 4000.

From 2013 onwards, the index demonstrated a strong upward trend, steadily increasing
from around 4,500 to above 6,000 by 2015. This growth indicates improved investor
confidence and gradual economic expansion during those years.

Between 2016 and 2019, the ASX200 maintained an overall upward movement, with a mild fluctuation.
The index reached its peak above 7,000 in early 2020, before facing a sharp decline to around
4,500, most likely due to the market shock from the COVID-19 pandemic. This pattern matches
with the research. On 2020 February 2020, stock markets across the word suddenly crashed after growing instability.
The crash ened on 7 April 2020. This trend is also capture in the graph as the index level grow again in mid
2020.
