# ASX 200 Market Analysis

Financial markets are highly dynamic, with prices often shifting rapidly in response to events such as political changes, global crises, and technological developments. These fluctuations create uncertainty for investors and organisations, making it important to understand when the market is entering periods of increased volatility.

The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate predictive models for detecting and forecasting volatility in the Australian share market. The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

Before predictive modelling can be performed, the dataset must be carefully prepared. This includes exploring relationships between the dependent variable (ASX 200 index) and independent variables such as other market indices, bond yields, and the RBA cash rate. Understanding these relationships helps assess their potential value as inputs for predictive models.
